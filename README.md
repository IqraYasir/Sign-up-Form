# Sign-up-Form
This project will be a chance to display intermediate HTML and CSS knowledge, and my first taste of creating forms.

EDIT: Went ok I guess. I initially wrote javascript to make it so the password fields had to be the same, but it didn't work for some reason, not sure why. Also the :focus pseudo class didn't work either so idk.
